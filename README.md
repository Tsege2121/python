1. **Introduction to SQL and Databases**

    1.1. What is SQL?

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It enables users to perform essential operations like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data, commonly referred to as CRUD operations. SQL is widely used across various database systems, with minor syntax differences, making it a critical skill for database management.
Stands for Structured Query Language
Used for CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
Standardized, but varies slightly (e.g., MySQL vs. PostgreSQL)
Declarative: specify desired results, not execution steps
Key applications:
Querying data
Managing database structures
Defining access controls

    1.2 Understanding Relational Databases
A relational database organizes data into structured tables, where each table represents an entity, such as Customers or Orders. Tables consist of rows (records) and columns (attributes), connected through keys like primary and foreign keys. This structure ensures data integrity and enables efficient querying through relationships.

Tables represent entities (e.g., Customers, Orders)
Structure:
Rows: individual records
Columns: attributes

Keys:
Primary key: unique identifier for a table
Foreign key: links to another table’s primary key

Benefits:
Maintains data integrity
Supports efficient querying

Example: CustomerID linking Customers and Orders

    1.3. Database Management Systems (DBMS) Overview
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that manages relational databases, handling tasks like data storage, retrieval, and security. Popular DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server, each supporting SQL with some unique features. Choosing a DBMS depends on project requirements, such as scalability or licensing.

Software for managing databases
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite
Functions:
Data storage and retrieval
Indexing and query optimization
User access and security

Selection criteria:
Project scale
Open-source vs. commercial needs

SQL support varies slightly by DBMS

    1.4. Creating a Database (CREATE DATABASE)
The CREATE DATABASE command initializes a new, empty database within a DBMS. This is the first step before creating tables or storing data. Database names should be unique and follow the DBMS’s naming conventions to avoid errors.

Command: CREATE DATABASE database_name;
Example: CREATE DATABASE my_store;
Notes:
Creates an empty database
Use unique names, avoid special characters
Optional settings: e.g., CHARACTER SET utf8
Check DBMS-specific naming rules

    1.5. Selecting a Database (USE)
The USE command selects a database as the active one for your SQL session. This is necessary before performing operations like creating tables or querying data, as it specifies the database context for subsequent commands.

Command: USE database_name;
Example: USE my_store;
Notes:
Sets active database for session
Required before table operations
Only one database active at a time
Database must exist

    1.6. Dropping a Database (DROP DATABASE)
The DROP DATABASE command deletes a database and all its contents, including tables and data. This action is permanent, so it must be used cautiously to avoid accidental data loss.

Command: DROP DATABASE database_name;
Example: DROP DATABASE my_store;
Notes:
Deletes entire database
Irreversible, use with caution
Use IF EXISTS to prevent errors
Requires appropriate permissions

    1.7. Managing Database Users and Permissions
Managing users and permissions ensures secure access to databases. DBMSs allow creating users and assigning specific privileges (e.g., SELECT, INSERT) to control what actions they can perform. This is critical for maintaining database security and integrity.

Key commands:
CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT privileges ON database.*TO 'username'@'host';
REVOKE privileges ON database.* FROM 'username'@'host';

Examples:
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON my_store.* TO 'app_user'@'localhost';

Notes:
Permissions can be operation- or table-specific
Follow least privilege principle
Regularly review access for security
